    "It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the rest of the book, often we will use a function definition to explain a concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as “find the smallest value in a list of values”. Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named `min` which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list."
